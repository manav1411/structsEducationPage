## Purpose
structs.sh is a visually educational platform about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).\
I supported this project by building the infrastructure for learning mode, where users can learn about various DSA more concretley than the visualisations.\
NOTE: I helped build the infrastructure, that will be used by writers to write articles, quizzes, etc, that users will use.
This project is available at: [structs.sh](https://structs.sh)

## Features
This repo is used to develop the education mode of structs, which was then merged with the main structs repo later.\
The primary repo for structs can be found [here](https://github.com/devsoc-unsw/structs.sh).\
<br>
for the user: education mode provides various DSA sections, their articles, corresponding quizzes, context-driven OpenAI generated quizzes, etc\
For the articule writer: education mode provides functionality of various tools to build MDX articles on education mode.\
there are 2 folders of note to the writer:
- learning material: folder with information about each learning module (linked lists, hash-maps, etc). each page has a link to its quiz page, and back button to roadmap.
- quiz pages: folder with quizzes, 1 for each module.
