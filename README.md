 ## FILE STRUCTURE
2 folders:
- learning material: folder with information about each learning module (linked lists, hash-maps, etc). each page has a link to its quiz page, and back button to roadmap.
- quiz pages: folder with quizzes, 1 for each module.

## ROADMAP  
a tree-like structure. has link to every learning module. nodes move slightly. when user hovers over a topic, its text-box grows in size.  
indicator of porgression/completion for each module, by making background of text-box more green based on % quiz completed.
