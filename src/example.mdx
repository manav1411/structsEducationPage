# <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello, MDX!</span>

here i am importing a react component:  
<MCquestion 
  question={{
    question: 'What is the capital of France?',
    options: ['London', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Madrid'],
    answerIndex: 1,
    answerExplanation: 'Correct! Paris is the capital of France.',
  }}
/>

Here is some **bold** text.

# just playing with MD currently!

hello, my name is blahhhhhhh

I am in xxxxxxx

you would like to know wouldn't you...

## fun facts

###### this is the smallest title size

nobody cares about king charles-> queens where its at


very important title!!
======================

yeah so that was a lie, it's not that important...

just like you!


this text was written on diff lines line break:  
but it will appear on the same line
in md. will repeat text now to see
behaviour of what hapens when I keep goingg.

### other formatting practice

**bold** text  is k**e**wlll  
but *italic* text is even coooo*o*oooler

we can do both: ***bold and italic***- fancy! it is ni***c***e

>what is a block quote? it is this.  
>we can have multiple lines too.
>
>or like this.

>we can even have nested block quotes. like this:
>
>>neato huh?

1. ordered lists
2. start with 1
3. doesn't matter
4. what you put in MD.
5. can restart by starting w 1 again like this:
1. hi!
2. hello...
3. can go into block quote too:
> 4. see!


- you can have unordered lists
- like this.
- just dot points!
- tabbing unordered lists
    - results in this
    - which i think is cool
        - can even go again. etc.


* here is the same type of lists
* but this time
    > we have a blockquote within!
* main list continues...

1. to write a code block  
2. we can simply indent w a tab like this:

        `is this like a code block?`  
        `this should also be part of the code block  `

3. yup!!

lets do images now!!  
here is one of a man using HTML:

<img src={manUrl} alt="unsexy man" />

okay that was fun.  
here is a sexier man:

<img src={manUrl2} alt="sexy man" />

here is a gif now.  
we could potentially have linked list gif like this??:  

<img src={manUrl3} alt="green man" />


here is a piece of `code`.  
as you can see, code is written differently. uses backticks

`int main(void) if ass multile ==== ok ? yes: for int`

here is a line?

---

which is diff from a heading, which is directly under the text.

here is what a link will look like:  
the link to my favourite website is [here](https://open.spotify.com "heyo bruv, this link goes to spotify!! :P")  
hover over the link to see hover text!

you can do formatting to links too like this: ***[bold and italics link!](https://google.com "going to google bruv")***  

finally, we've used lots of characters for special reasons.  
to use them normally, just add \ infront. e.g.  
\- this would've been a list otherwise!
