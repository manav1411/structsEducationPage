# Linked Lists

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. Unlike arrays, which store their elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store their elements in nodes that are scattered throughout memory. Each node in a linked list contains two pieces of information: the data it holds and a reference, also known as a pointer, to the next node in the list.

Linked lists can be used for a variety of purposes, such as implementing stacks, queues, and hash tables. There are several types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

A singly linked list is a linked list where each node has a reference to the next node in the list, but not the previous node. This makes it easy to traverse the list in one direction, but difficult to traverse it in reverse. A doubly linked list, on the other hand, is a linked list where each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes in the list, making it easy to traverse the list in both directions.

A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node contains a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure. This is useful in situations where you need to traverse the list continuously without hitting the end.


## Anatomy of a Linked List

A linked list is made up of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two pieces of information:

- **Data**: The actual value or payload that the node holds.
- **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

Here's an example of a linked list that contains three nodes:

In this example, each node contains a piece of data and a reference to the next node. The first node is the head of the list, and the last node is the tail.

Linked lists support various operations, including inserting, deleting, and searching for elements. Inserting an element at the beginning of a linked list is a simple operation that involves creating a new node and pointing it to the current head of the list. Inserting an element at the end of a linked list, however, can be more complicated because you need to traverse the entire list to find the last node.

Deleting an element from a linked list involves updating the pointers of the nodes before and after the node you want to delete so that they point to each other directly, effectively skipping over the node you want to remove. Searching for an element in a linked list involves traversing the list until you find the element you're looking for, or until you reach the end of the list.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are several types of linked lists, including:

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains a reference to the next node in the list.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains a reference to both the next and previous nodes in the list.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the list contains a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure.

When working with linked lists, it's important to keep track of the head and tail nodes, as well as the length of the list. Head and tail nodes are used as references for insertion and deletion operations, while the length of the list is used for implementing various algorithms.

The time complexity of various operations on linked lists depends on the type of linked list and the location of the node you want to access. For example, accessing the first node in a singly linked list is a constant time operation, while accessing the last node in a singly linked list is an O(n) operation.

Congratulations, you've completed your linked list tutorial!

In conclusion, linked lists are a powerful data structure that are widely used in computer science and programming. They provide a flexible and efficient way of storing and manipulating data, and can be easily adapted to suit a wide range of applications. With a solid understanding of how linked lists work and how to implement common operations, you can start incorporating this versatile data structure into your own projects.
