# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure used to store a sequence of elements, 
where each element points to the next one in the sequence. Unlike an array, which stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list stores its elements in nodes that are scattered throughout memory, and each node contains a reference to the next node in the list.

## Anatomy of a Linked List

A linked list is made up of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains two pieces of information:

- **Data**: The actual value or payload that the node holds.
- **Next**: A reference to the next node in the list.

Here's an example of a linked list that contains three nodes:

In this example, each node contains a piece of data and a reference to the next node. The first node is the head of the list, and the last node is the tail.

## Types of Linked Lists

There are several types of linked lists, including:

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node contains a reference to the next node in the list.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains a reference to both the next and previous nodes in the list.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node in the list contains a reference to the first node, creating a circular structure.

## Quiz Time!

Let's test your understanding of linked lists with some multiple-choice questions:

<MCquestion 
  question={{
    question: 'What is a linked list?',
    options: [
      'A data structure used to store a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.',
      'A way to link two computers together so they can share data.',
      'A list of hyperlinks on a web page.',
      'A list of items that are sorted in ascending order.'
    ],

    answerExplanation: 'Correct! A linked list is a data structure used to store a sequence of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.',
  }}

<MCquestion 
  question={{
    question: 'What is the difference between an array and a linked list?',
    options: [
      'An array stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, while a linked list stores its elements in scattered memory locations.',
      'An array can only hold one type of data, while a linked list can hold multiple types of data.',
      'An array is faster than a linked list for accessing elements, but a linked list is faster for inserting and deleting elements.',
      'An array is a linear data structure, while a linked list is a hierarchical data structure.'
    ],
    answerIndex: 0,
    answerExplanation: 'Correct! An array stores its elements in contiguous memory locations, while a linked list stores its elements in scattered memory locations.',
  }}
/>

<MCquestion 
  question={{
    question: 'What is the tail of a linked list?',
    options: [
      'The last node in the list.',
      'The first node in the list.',
      'The node that contains the smallest value.',
      'The node that contains the largest value.'
    ],
    answerIndex: 0,
    answerExplanation: 'Correct! The tail of a linked list is the last node in the list.',
  }}
/>

Congratulations, you've completed blahh.
