<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      text: 'What is an array?',
      options: [
        'A data structure where elements are stored in nodes',
        'A data structure where each element points to the next one',
        'A type of tree data structure',
        'A collection of elements of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations',
      ],
      answerIndex: 3,
      answerExplanation: 'An array is a collection of elements of the same type that are stored in contiguous memory locations.',
    },
    {
      text: 'What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array by its index?',
      options: [
        'O(1)',
        'O(log n)',
        'O(n)',
        'O(n^2)',
      ],
      answerIndex: 0,
      answerExplanation: 'Accessing an element in an array by its index has a time complexity of O(1), because the index can be used to directly access its memory location.',
    },
    {
      text: 'What is the time complexity of inserting an element at the beginning of an array?',
      options: [
        'O(1)',
        'O(log n)',
        'O(n)',
        'O(n^2)',
      ],
      answerIndex: 2,
      answerExplanation: 'Inserting an element at the beginning of an array requires shifting all existing elements to the right, which takes O(n) time complexity in the worst case.',
    },
