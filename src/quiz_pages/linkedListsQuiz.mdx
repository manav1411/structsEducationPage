Test your knowledge of linked lists with this 3-question quiz!

<Quiz
  questions={[
    {
      text: 'What is a linked list?',
      options: [
        'A data structure where elements are stored in nodes',
        'A data structure where each element points to the next one',
        'A type of tree data structure',
        'A method for storing data in a hash table',
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'A linked list is a data structure where each element points to the next one, forming a chain of elements.',
    },
    {
      text: 'What is the time complexity of searching for an element in a singly linked list?',
      options: [
        'O(1)',
        'O(log n)',
        'O(n)',
        'O(n^2)',
      ],
      answerIndex: 2,
      answerExplanation: 'Searching for an element in a singly linked list requires O(n) time complexity, as we need to traverse the entire list in the worst case.',
    },
    {
      text: 'Which type of linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions?',
      options: [
        'Singly linked list',
        'Doubly linked list',
        'Circular linked list',
        'None of the above',
      ],
      answerIndex: 1,
      answerExplanation: 'A doubly linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions, as each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.',
    },
