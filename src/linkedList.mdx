A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the **data** and the **address** of the next node. For example,

You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called HEAD. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to NULL.
